## Today I Learned

A growing collection of things I learned while working together with the awesome [AOEpeople](https://github.com/AOEpeople/).

### Git
* [Render a simple list of all changes committed to a Git repository since the last tag](git/changelog_from_history.md)

### PHPUnit
* [Assert that an exception is not thrown in a PHPUnit test](phpunit/assert-exception-not-thrown.md)
